# World of Warcraft Reforged

Open world role-playing game and strategy map for Warcraft III: Reforged based on [World of Warcraft Reborn](https://maps.w3reforged.com/maps/categories/other/world-of-warcraft-rebornr) featuring computer AI support which allows you to play the map offline.
This map is not a recreation of the game World of Warcraft but is inspired by and uses some lore from the game.


Official website: [wowreforged.org](https://wowreforged.org)

GitHub Repository of the official website: [wowr-website](https://github.com/tdauth/wowr-website)

The map is in the folder [wowr.w3x](./wowr.w3x) and can be modified with the Warcraft III: Reforged World Editor.

* [Current development version](./wowr.w3x): Use [this page](https://download-directory.github.io/) with the URL <https://github.com/tdauth/wowr/tree/master/wowr.w3x> to download the directory, open it with the World Editor and save it as a Frozen Throne scenario to play it. It is stored as folder to avoid a big history.


Download and place the map file `wowr[version].w3x` into the folder `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\Warcraft III\Maps\Download`.
Start Warcraft III: Reforged and play a custom game by choosing the map.


*Enable HD graphics in older versions of the map:* Older versions of the map are restricted to SD graphics to avoid performance issues.
However, you can easily remove this restriction by opening and modifying the map with the World Editor.
Load the map in the World Editor and go to "Scenario" -> "Map Options ..." -> "Supported modes:" -> Choose "SD and HD" -> press OK -> save the map.

## Frozen Throne Support

This map has been developed for Warcraft III: Reforged.
However, it can be adapted for the old Frozen Throne version.
Use the tool [Map Adapter](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/map-adapter.326456/) or adapt the map manually.
JASS natives which only exist in Reforged must be replaced with custom functions.
You have to adapt the [common.j](./wowr.w3x/scripts/common.j) file and remove natives which do not exist in Frozen Throne.
You have to add all of these natives to the map script [war3map.j](./wowr.w3x/scripts/war3map.j) as user-defined JASS functions.
Modify any map file manually with an MPQ editor like [Ladik's MPQ Editor](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/ladiks-mpq-editor-version-2-0-1-278.91512/).

## On the Limitations of Warcraft III

This project exists for several years now.
These years helped me to get some experience with the limitations of the Warcraft III engine as well as the changes and bugs introduced by Reforged.
Hence, one should be really careful to add new features and new content.
For example, a high number of ability levels will slow down the loading time massively.
A high number of preplaced units and other objects will heavily decrease the FPS.
Custom AI scripts can lead to crashes depending on the space the AI is given at start and map size in total.
Therefore it seems to be a good idea to keep everything a bit smaller than it theoretically could be.
A lower hero level like 30 or 20 or even 15 (like in the Bonus Campaign) will keep the hero ability levels lower and therefore improve the loading time and number of translatable strings.
Besides, the number of preskilled ability levels for boss heroes stays low and there is less need for researches like Evolution/progression of world creeps.
A smaller map area leads to less preplaced objects and much better FPS as well as less crashes with AI.
Computer players need enough space for build their base or otherwise the game will crash.
Keep the number of custom scripts low and make sure that periodic scripts won't affect the performance.
Custom models with high polygon count will affect the FPS as well.
Make sure that custom assets have a low file size and a certain quality standard before using them.
A huge map area will also make the minimap much smaller and pretty much almost useless.
Cliff types are restricted to only two being rendered which limits areas such as Outland using its own cliff type.
Use the 16 different tile types wisely.

## Computer AI

The map uses Warcraft's AI for computer players.
The map contains the modified [common.j](./wowr.w3x/scripts/common.j) to make constants available to map triggers AND AI scripts at once.
The map contains the modified [common.ai](./wowr.w3x/scripts/common.ai) which is used by all custom AI scripts.
Run [check.bat](./check.bat) on Windows to check all custom AI scripts for syntax errors before releasing the map.

### Warlords

The *.ai files from [war3mapImported](./wowr.w3x/war3mapImported) folder contain a very basic warlord AI for computer players.
Warlord computer players start with a town hall and workers besides their hero.
they will get a new town hall automatically to rebuild their base if the auto respawn is enabled whenever they lose all workers and town halls.
This prevents ending the game for an AI.

### Freelancers

The file [Freelancer.ai](./wowr.w3x/war3mapImported/Freelancer.ai) is imported into the map whenever it is updated.
It contains a very basic freelancer AI for computer players.

## Custom Systems

The map uses several custom systems created by Baradé which can be used in any other map.
They are available in [systems](./systems).
Each system provides a prototype map which shows you how to use it.

## Custom FDF Files

All custom FDF files are listed in the file [wowrTOC.toc](./wowr.w3x/war3mapImported/wowrTOC.toc).
It has to be loaded with `BlzLoadTOCFile` before using any `GetLocalizedString` calls.

## Internationalization

There can be translations of the map into different languages.
These are the existing translations so far:

* 🇺🇸 [English map strings](./wowr.w3x/war3map.wts), [English global strings](./wowr.w3x/war3mapImported/WoWReforgedStrings.fdf), [English Gameplay Constants](./wowr.w3x/war3mapMisc.txt)
* 🇩🇪 [German map strings](./wowr.w3x/_Locales/deDE.w3mod/war3map.wts), [German global strings](./wowr.w3x/_Locales/deDE.w3mod/war3mapImported/WoWReforgedStrings.fdf), [German Gameplay Constants](./wowr.w3x/_Locales/deDE.w3mod/war3mapMisc.txt)

The files have to be updated according to the English files which are the main files.
Strings in custom scripts should always refer to entries from the global strings FDF file:

```
Format(GetLocalizedString("SETTINGS_PLAYERS")).i(GetPlayers()).result()
```

The function Format is part of the library StringFormat.
Use [diffstrings.bat](./diffstrings.bat) to compare the translation files with the original ones.

## Release Process

Open the folder [wowr.w3x](./wowr.w3x) with the World Editor and save the map as wowrX.Y.w3x.
Use this check list when releasing a new version of the map:

* Add all credits from this README to the map to make them appear in the quest log.
* Add all changes to the ChangeLog in the quest log.
* Make sure that the global variables for the map and the game are split into the proper trigger editor folders. There should be no top level "Variables" folder in trigger editor.
* Make sure that the modified files [common.j](./wowr.w3x/scripts/common.j) and [common.ai](./wowr.w3x/scripts/common.ai) are up to date with the latest Warcraft III: Reforged patch.
* Use [check.bat](./check.bat) to check all JASS scripts and FDF files. It uses the JAR fdfparser-1.0.jar from [WarsmashModEngine](https://github.com/Retera/WarsmashModEngine) for FDF parsing.
* Check all translation files in the [_Locales](./wowr.w3x/_Locales/) folder. Use [diffstrings.bat](./diffstrings.bat) to compare the translation files with the original ones.
* Make sure that save games still work by saving and loading.
* Use the cheat "-savecodeduplicates" to check for duplicated save code objects.
* Use the cheat "-savecodemissing" to check for missing save code objects.
* Use the cheat "-checkheroskills" to check for all registered hero spells.
* Disable triggers for debugging or generating data only like "WoW Reforged Website" which only adds more code to the map script.
* Make sure the imported data is working and there are no corrupted or big files added by mistake. Check for imported files with a big size or 0 size.
* Save the map as wowrX.Y.w3x and tag the repo with X.Y and create a release on GitHub based on the tag.
* Upload the release on as many modding websites as possible.
* Announce the new release on Discord.

## Modifications with World Editor

Saving the map takes some time due to the big number of objects.
Hence, you can use the "Validate Map Triggers (F10)" action in the trigger editor before actually saving the map to make sure there won't be any syntax error.

## Known Reasons for Crashes

Sometimes versions of this map might lead to crashing but since it is really hard to debug Warcraft maps, there are only some possible known reasons for crashes we have experienced so far:

* Missing pathing for buildings constructed by the AI.
* Lower number for maximum number than minimum number of summoned units for Dark Portal based abilities.
* Training of certain unit types by the AI.
* Not enough space for AI to build its base.
* `CreateRegion` in globals instead of a JASS function crashes the game on saving it.
* String literals which are longer than 1023 characters will lead to crashes on loading save games.
* Using trigger conditions instead of trigger actions for triggers with events `EVENT_PLAYER_UNIT_SELECTED` and `EVENT_PLAYER_UNIT_DESELECTED` will lead to weird desync bugs and unselecting selected units.

## History of the Map

Warcraft III: Reforged is a fun map based on [World of Warcraft Reborn](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/world-of-warcraft-reborn.80480/#resource-3941) which has been created by the users DeMoNiKuS and EvilPitlord.
DeMoNiKuS modified the map World of Warcraft by EvilPitlord.
The original map had no trigger data, so all triggers had to be recreated based on the original map script.
The original map script has been added to this repository as well as the original map strings:

* [war3map.j](./original_map/war3map.j)
* [war3map.wts](./translations/war3map.wts)

### Other Modified Versions

Look into the folder [original_map_modified](./original_map_modified) where some of the modified versions of the original map are stored.
Here is a list of some modified versions online:

* [World of War in Warcraft 2.03b](https://www.epicwar.com/maps/2673/)
* [World of Warcraft Reborn 2](https://www.epicwar.com/maps/40351/)
* [World of Warcraft 1.8](https://www.epicwar.com/maps/228752)
* [WoW Reanimated](https://maps.w3reforged.com/maps/categories/role-play-game-rpg/wow-reanimated): Complete revision of the original map. It has many more dungeons, professions, heroes and races but no AI support and is missing lots of features from this map.
