# World of Warcraft Reforged

Open world role-playing game funmap for Warcraft III: Reforged based on [World of Warcraft Reborn](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/world-of-warcraft-reborn.80480/) featuring computer AI support which allows you to play the map offline.

## Play the Map

* [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/eM34z36)
* [Official download on Hiveworkshop](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/world-of-warcraft-tsr-1-4.304616/)
* [Official download on Warcraft 3: Reforged - Map database](https://maps.w3reforged.com/maps/categories/role-play-game-rpg/world-of-warcraft-reforged-18-792265)
* [Current development version](./wowr2.1.w3x)

*Restriction to SD graphics:* The map is restricted to SD graphics to avoid performance issues. However, you can easily remove this restriction by opening and modifying the map with the World Editor.

## How to Play

Usually, it is the best to ally one Freelancer with one Warlord from the beginning.
The Warlord can support the Freelancer with units, resources and XP and the Freelancer can level faster.
Alliances can be made via Warcraft's menu. Build many custom goldmines as Warlords to collect gold much faster.
Defend your base with towers and close the gates if necessary.
Strong bases are almost impossible to conquer.
Find some good creep spots or enemies (maybe Warlord AI) to level your hero constantly.
A big army helps leveling much faster, so either train and upgrade units or get support from a Warlord.
Prevent hostile players from leveling and completing quests by hunting them down constantly.
However, this could lead to making them leave quickly and it's not the best strategy if you want to play a long game.
You can change alliances and offer others your services to get an alliance in return.
This strategy works best for new players who need some support in the beginning.
Killing bosses and completing quests will give you better items and a big advantage during fights.
It is always more fun if you communicate with other players and think of your own stories and quests.

## Bug Fixes

This version contains fixes of several bugs from the original map [World of Warcraft Reborn](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/world-of-warcraft-reborn.80480/):

* When placing a building at creep spawns, the creeps will respawn when the building is destroyed. In the original map the creeps did never respawn again.
* The quest with Maiev was bugged in the original map. Maiev could not be moved.
* Summoned units won't respawn again like regular creeps.
* Undead housings can be used as Undead goldmines.

## Computer AI

The map uses Warcraft's AI for computer players.

### Warlords

The following files are imported into the map whenever they are updated. They contain a very basic warlord AI for computer players:

* [Human.ai](./ai/Human.ai)
* [Orc.ai](./ai/Orc.ai)
* [Undead.ai](./ai/Undead.ai)
* [NightElf.ai](./ai/NightElf.ai)
* [Naga.ai](./ai/Naga.ai)
* [BloodElf.ai](./ai/BloodElf.ai)
* [Demon.ai](./ai/Demon.ai)
* [Draenei.ai](./ai/Draenei.ai)
* [Furbolg.ai](./ai/Furbolg.ai)
* [Goblin.ai](./ai/Goblin.ai)
* [Dwarf.ai](./ai/Dwarf.ai)
* [HighElf.ai](./ai/HighElf.ai)
* [TheBurningLegion.ai](./ai/TheBurningLegion.ai)
* [TheAlliance.ai](./ai/TheAlliance.ai)

The race is determined from the race set in the lobby of the game:

* If the race is Human it will either be Human, Blood Elf, Dwarf or High Elf.
* If the race is Orc it will either be Orc, Draenei or Goblin.
* If the race is Undead it will either be Undead or Demon.
* If the race is Night Elf it will either be Night Elf, Naga or Furbolg.

Warlord computer players start with a town hall and workers besides their hero.
Whenever they lose all workers and town halls, they will get a new town hall automatically to rebuild their base.
This prevents ending the game for an AI.

### Freelancers

The file [Freelancer.ai](./ai/Freelancer.ai) is imported into the map whenever it is updated. It contains a very basic freelancer AI for computer players.

## Replays

Some interesting replays are stored in [replays](./replays).

## Crashes

At the moment the map seems to end after some time. We played some games for one hour and suddenly the game ended and all players saw the score screen.
Hence, I am trying to collect replays with the game ending to reconstruct the bug.

[crashes](./crashes) contains folders with map and replay files of the corresponding games.

### Known Reasons for Crashing

* Missing pathing for buildings constructed by the AI.
* Lower number for maximum number than minimum number of summoned units for Dark Portal based abilities.
* Training of certain unit types by the AI.

## History of the Map

Warcraft III: Reforged is a fun map based on [World of Warcraft Reborn](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/world-of-warcraft-reborn.80480/#resource-3941) which has been created by the users DeMoNiKuS and EvilPitlord.
DeMoNiKuS modified the map World of Warcraft by EvilPitlord.

### Reconstruction

The original map had no trigger data, so all triggers had to be recreated based on the original map script.
The original map script has been added to this repository as well as the original map strings:

* [war3map.j](./original_map/war3map.j)
* [war3map.wts](./translations/war3map.wts)

### Other Modified Versions

Look into the folder [original_map_modified](./original_map_modified) where some of the modified versions of the original map are stored.
Here is a list of some modified versions online:

* [World of War in Warcraft 2.03b](https://www.epicwar.com/maps/2673/)
* [World of Warcraft Reborn 2](https://www.epicwar.com/maps/40351/)
* [World of Warcraft 1.8](https://www.epicwar.com/maps/228752)

### Other Variants

Some maps are not really based on the original map World of Warcraft Reborn but a complete revision of the map:

* [WoW Reanimated](https://maps.w3reforged.com/maps/categories/role-play-game-rpg/wow-reanimated): This map has many more dungeons, professions, heroes and races but no AI support and is missing lots of features from this map.
