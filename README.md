# World of Warcraft The Second Rebirth
This is a map based on [World of Warcraft Reborn](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/world-of-warcraft-reborn.80480/#resource-3941) which has been made by the user DeMoNiKuS.
The original map had no trigger data, so all triggers had to be recreated based on the original map script.

This version provides several new features compared to the original map:
* 12 players instead of 10.
* Backpack system.
* Repicking hero with the chat command "-repick".
* Increased maximum hero level.
* Increased maximum hero ability levels.
* Every hero has the ability "Attribute Bonus".
* Translation into German.

It does also fix several bugs of the original map:
* When placing a building at creep spawns, the creeps will respawn when the building is destroyed. In the original map the creeps did never respawn again.
* The quest with Maiev was bugged in the original map. Maiev could not be moved.
