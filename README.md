# World of Warcraft The Second Rebirth
This is a map based on [World of Warcraft Reborn](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/world-of-warcraft-reborn.80480/#resource-3941) which has been made by the user DeMoNiKuS.
He himself modified the map World of Warcraft by the user EvilPitlord.
The original map had no trigger data, so all triggers had to be recreated based on the original map script.

This version provides several new features compared to the original map:
* 12 players instead of 10.
* Backpack system.
* Repicking hero with the chat command "-repick".
* Increased maximum hero level.
* Increased maximum hero ability levels.
* Every hero has the ability "Attribute Bonus".
* Increased boss levels.
* New heroes from the TFT expansions are available.
* Translation into German.
* Trees have 5000 hitpoints which allows longer harvesting before restoring the trees.
* Night Elves workers harvest 10 lumber per interval as balance.
* The race item can be dropped.
* Naga can build a shop.
* Naga villagers can walk on water.
* Increased the maximum supply to 300 and the supply cost levels to 100 and 200.
* Added outland area with a new boss.
* "-nowin" replaced "nodefeat". The game can be won by killing the final boss in the outland area.

It does also fix several bugs of the original map:
* When placing a building at creep spawns, the creeps will respawn when the building is destroyed. In the original map the creeps did never respawn again.
* The quest with Maiev was bugged in the original map. Maiev could not be moved.
* Summoned units won't respawn again like regular creeps.
