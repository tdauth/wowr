Stats Tomes

STRING 56
{
I have not included any form of Hero stat incresing tomes in the map for a specific reason. They would greatly imbalance the game and ruin the game concept. Heroes in this map are designed to stay MORTAL. This means no god-like heroes for the small kids who want to run around and kill everything ! Also completing quests would be far too easy with super-stats but the map quests are designed to have a certain amount of challenge. So, as mentioned, if you really want to add tomes with the editor, do it. However, i don´t appreciate it and don´t want any kind of complaints about map copies with tomes included.

Welcome to WoW Reborn !
}

STRING 761
{
Welcome to World of Warcraft Reborn open RPG ! Open RPG means, players can do whatever they want, even hunt other players (which is recommended in order to keep the whole thing a bit more exciting =) ...
Additionally, there are optional quests to do for famous Warcraft Heros of the past. And for the very brave ones, on every continent there is at least 1 dungeon with over-the-average powerful creeps and Dungeon Masters who guard powerful artifacts..
In Here are the few rules every player must stick to:
- You can choose only 1 Hero and can NOT repick ! This is to prevent map bug creation and bug abuse.
- You have to choose 1 Profession which effectively gives your Hero some item crafting skills. In addition you can craft and sell items in nearby Marketplaces to raise your funds. You can NOT drop your profession book due to game system abuse probability.
- You have to choose Warlord or Freelacer status. Warlords can build cities and mine gold. Freelancers can not build cities but Hideouts. They get some extra stats in the game start.
- You can become Demigod of Good or Evil (see the quest menu paragraph for more information on this subject.

Have fun and enjoy...THE WORLD OF WARCRAFT !

Cities and Hideouts
}

STRING 763
{
Every warlord-type Hero has a nation-specific scepter. With this he or she can summon workers who will start building their nations. It is recommended that they build within city walls becasue the probability of their buildings being attacked by creeps or "terrorist" Heros is considerably lowered. Also, they can spawn citizens and build housings for them. Citizens make your town more realistic and also have some useful abilities.

Hideouts are for Freelancer Heros. They are their personal homes and provide among other things a safe place to recover. It should be considered building them within city walls or under the protection of a warlord player to lower destruction probability.

NPC Quests
}

STRING 767

There are several NPC Heros which you will recognize from the original Warcraft Campaigns. They can give your Heros special quests to do for them. Once someone completes the required quest for the NPC, he or she will be able to give you another quest which is more difficult than the previous. In every nation it is possible to fulfill up to 4 quests for the NPCs. For example, the Orcs will have 2 Quests given to you by Thrall and 2 Quests given by Cairne Bloodhoof, which makes a total of 4 quests.

STRING 768
{
Demigod of Good or Evil
}

STRING 769
{
Every player can become a demigod of good or evil by capturing 1 Dragon of every color. This choice means to sacrifice your Hero for the Eternal Guardian (light side) or Hand of Destruction (dark side). However the process of getting this status is very difficult, because the consequences for other players can be fatal once someone gets these new powers. In order to prove worthyness of  these powers, you have to do 2 things: Depending on which side you want to be, you have to have 1 Order Stone Fragment or Chaos Stone Fragment in your inventory. You can get the fragments by searching for and finding the locations of the complete Stones (the Order stone fragment is in fact at the temple. The stones themselves also have some magical powers). Then find 1 Dragon of each type and bring them to the newly raised Dragon Temple in the deep ocean: Red Dragon, Blue Dragon, Black Dragon, Bronze Dragon and Green Dragon. Place every one of them on the appropriate circle of power in the temple and step into the center circle to perform the ascension ritual.
The Dragon Roosts that let you get the dragons are shattered throughout the world so it can be a very long quest to find them all and collect all 5 Dragons. Also there may be some fierce creatures guarding the ancient Temple Ruins which have recently been raised from the ocean floor. Once you become a demigod, you can upgrade your Guardian´s Tower or Tier 3 Town Hall to a Temple of Light or Darkness after researching the Demigod Temple upgrade.

Legends and rumors speak of many legendary Artifacts hidden across the World. The bad news is, you can´t get them for free, but in order to retrieve them, must defeat each Dungeon Master guarding them. Since the Artifact Guardians are very powerful, it is advised not to venture alone into their lairs, or at least not well prepared.

If a Hero carrying a unique artifact DIES without an Ankh or the Reincarnation skill, the artifacts will be removed from the Hero. They can then again be retrieved from the location where they were originally found.

King Magni Bronzebeard requires brave adventurers to travel into the unexplored corridors deep under the city, and if the rumor is true,  bring a Battle Golem to him as a proof of the factory´s existence !

STRING 1139
{
The City of Darnassus is flourishing as hoped. However, there seems to be a problem with the Night Elf housings around the new World Tree. They are somehow falling apart. Apparently this seems to be a side-effect of the World Tree´s growing. Tyrande needs a special Spell from the Druids of the Talon to enhance the structures and shield them from the World Tree´s damaging magic. She requires a Hero to travel to the Barrow Dens in Ashenvale, find the druids and recover the Spell for her. Although this is only a small running job, there will be a reward for the Hero´s efforts to help the Night Elves.

}

STRING 1141
{
Ever since the destruction of the Demon Archimonde near the World Tree, its regeneration has somehow been strange. The Arch-Druid Furion suspects some kind of corruption of the magical waters the World Tree is feeding from...
Since the dispelling of demonic magicks is the speciality of the Paladins of the Silver Hand, Furion needs their help. Someone must seek the head of their Order who is currently in Nethergarde Citadel in Azeroth and get a sample of blessed water from him. Pouring the blessed water into the Well of Eternity should dispel any remnants of demonic corruption in it.

She believes that with the help of the Arch-Sorceress Jaina Proudmoore, she could dispel the eclipse and also enhance the moon stones so that such an accident does not occur again. The mission is simple: travel to Theramore, and let Jaina enhance the moon stone Tyrande gave you. Afterwards return to it to Tyrande and receive a small reward for  helping the Night Elves !

STRING 1145

After the Legion´s defeat on Kalimdor, the Night Elves seem to have  overlooked something. There is still a defiled Fountain somewhere in Fellwood, probably the source of the Warsong Clan´s former corruption. To prevent other creatures to drink from it, Furion asks you to travel to the nearby Felwood Forest, find the Defiled Fountain and destroy it. But be on your guard, since there seem to be remnants of the Dark Legion´s strike force that the Night Elves have not yet eliminated !

The Orcish nation of Durotar is prospering well. Under the guidance of Warchief Thrall, they have established a council of elders that is responsible for establishing order and laws among the hot-headed Orcs. Although the Night Elves and Humans already have written codes of law, this is something totally new for the young nation of Orcs. Thrall promised to keep the Night Elves informed about the progress of Durotar´s legislative acts. Since his former running pet, Rexxar, has moved to the wilds again, Thrall needs a new errand boy. Your Hero has to take the Code of Laws tome and take it to Tyrande on Teldrassil Isle. Afterwards you can return to Thrall and claim you payment for the job.

The Tauren see their opportunity to strike a blow at the centaurs in order to lower their battle morale and cause confusion among them.

After having returned from Outland, Illidan, Kael and Vashj have devised a new plan to strike at the Lich King. However, Lord Illidan needs a special Artifact which he can only get from his Master, Kil´Jaeden himself. He is currently somewhere in the Tomb of Sargeras, for reasons unknown. Your Hero must travel to the Tomb of Sargeras near the Maelstrom, find Kil´Jaeden, get the Artifact from him and return it to Illidan. Kil´Jaeden may be somewhat be aroused by the lost battle at Icecrown Glacier, so watch your steps carefully.

STRING 1157
{
Lord Illidan is getting tired of being chased by the Night Elf Warden Maiev Shadowsong. Before the next step to strike at the Lich King, Illidan wants the Warden matter solved first. According to spy reports, Maiev and her group of Huntresses have currently set up a base camp near the Naga Temple Ruins, giving you the chance to conduct a surprise attack ! However, Illidan wants Maiev alive. You will have to use a special magical scroll Kael has made to prevent Maiev from using her teleporting skills and capture her. The quest is to find Maiev and use the Arcane Scroll near her in order to activate the spell. Afterwards, return Maiev to Illidan and claim your reward !

STRING 1158

Sapphiron
}

STRING 1159
{
The time to strike at the Lich King is coming near. But before, a final step is needed. There is a mighty Frost Wyrm called Sapphiron who watches every movement in and out of Icecrown. Lord Illidan requires you to destroy it in order to get to the Icecrown Glacier undetected ! The Dragon is however protected by a spell that prevents him from being harmed in any way. Lady Vashj has created a special Spell that will dispel the protection of the Frost Wyrm and make it vulnerable. The quest is to travel to Icecrown, find Sapphiron´s Lair, use the magic scroll near the Dragon and after the invulnerability is dispelled, kill it. Afterwards return the creature´s head to Lord Illidan. This time Sapphiron stays dead !
}

STRING 1161
{
It is time to strike at the Lich King himself ! Illidan has a score to settle with Arthas. However, the subject of this campaign is not to destroy the Lich King himself since his powers are still far too great at the moment. Even after striking down his mortal body, his dark sorcery will bring him back to life. But his temporary death will be enough to accomplish the actual quest: the Lich King created a powerful device that would allow him to increase his evil sorceries to a tremendous extent. Fortunately he has not yet used it. This must be prevented at all costs or a catastrophe that affects the whole world could occour with consequences not even Lord Illidan can predict. Recently Kil´Jaeden has given Illidan a special ring that will prevent Frostmourne´s powers from permanently destroying Illidan. However, in order to destroy the Lich King´s artifact, Illidan needs to enhance his double-bladed weapon first with sacred waters from a certain magical well. Take his Blade to the Sunnwell in Silvermoon, and after they are enhanced by the magic waters of the Sunwell, return the blade to Illidan. Afterwards guide Illidan himself to the Frozen Throne and conduct a surprise attack on the Dark Knight !

The Orcish warriors are the fiercest warriors known and they would be a valuable addition to the Forsaken Army. The Dark Lady Sylvanas has devised a plan to enslave the unsuspecting Orcs and turn them into the undead. To realize this idea, it will take several steps. At first, Sylvanas needs the Life essence of a Nether Drake. Your Hero needs to travel to Nethergarde Citadel and summon a Nether Drake Hatchling through the Dark Portal there. Afterwards return the creature to Sylvanas in the Undercity and claim your reward !

The Faceless Ones of Azjul-Nerub have drawn the Lich King´ interest in them. He wants them as part of the scourge, but he needs more magic power in order to control them. Anub´Arak has received word from Kel´Thuzad that the Lich King´s power could be increased to that extent with a special ritual. The Lich will however need some items first to unravel the spell. The ancient Night Elves´ Demigod, Cenarius, lies buried somewhere in Ashenvale Forest. First, your Hero must travel to Ashenvale and find a corpse probe of the dead creature. Afterwards take it to the Sunwell Grove in the Silvermoon Ruins where Kel´Thuzad will await your arrival.

Fortunately as it is, the Horn seems to be guarded only by a few creatures and is vulnerable to theft. But in order to remove it from the pedestal that magically holds it, you need a special totem that Kel´Thuzad has created. The mission is simple: Sneak with the Lich´s relic to the Horn in Ashenvale Forest, destroy the Spirits who guard the Horn and afterwards return the Horn to Kel´Thuzad.

Hiring Faceless Ones in Draktharon Keep (Anub´Arak) might be clever in order to accomplish this difficult task. After you complete your Quest, return to Arthas and claim your reward !
